# GymSchedule
Project for a faculty course Web programming 
Web application made for making and scheduling training dates in specific gyms. 
Web application with a help of a windows form app for insering data into the database (this is needed for simulating the actual work done by workers in the gyms - reading the card number, changing the working hours and capacity/hour).
Its sole purpose is for passing the condition for an exam, and to improve my programming skills and spread the work area.
